## R1 Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app.
#### - This particular app will better assist us in keeping track the type of equipments that we have spread out every locations around Australia, parts that will be required for each equipments, services that needed to be done on the equipments whether it be a major services, minor services or breakdowns. Once all this problems can be solved, it will then be keep track and accessible for different users to go throughs and make changes as required.

## R2 Why is it a problem that needs solving?
#### - Due to the expansion in the company with the rapid sales of equipments to the customers, we need to come up with a solution that can be keep track easily by different members of the teams in relates to parts, sites to attend that will have different type of equipments number. By doing so, every team members can do their part in updating the required informations. 

## R3 Why have you chosen this database system. What are the drawbacks compared to others?
#### The main reason I chosen PostgreSQL as my database system was mainly because I was taught about it. As a beginner in the programming world, it is easier for me to use what I was taught before venturing into other database system.
 - While PostgreSQL do offer good overall performance, high transactions environments might not be suitable for such database.
 - I have not dive in deep into PostgreSQL but the advanced features & flexibility can result in steeper learning curve for new beginners like myself. It may require more time & effort to be proficient in the database.
 - Even though PostgreSQL might have a robust ecosystem, it might not be as extensive for certain specialized use cases compare to some other database system that will have more extensive ecosystem of third party-tools, libraries as well as plugins.

## R4 Identify and discuss the key functionalities and benefits of an ORM
### Key Functionalities
- Mapping objects to tables
    - ORM tools allow me to map my applications models to related database tables. Each class will corresponds to a table & it's arritributes map to columns.
- Relationship Management
    - ORM allows us to define and manage relationships between objects, whether it be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many relationships.
- Database Queries Abstraction
    - Using ORM, we can perform database operations(SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE & DELETE) using object-oriented code than having to write SQL queries manually.

### Benefits
- Portability
    - Abstracting SQL queires, ORM makes it easier to switch around different database systems without having to re-write significant portions of the code.
- Maintainability
    - ORM tools help us to keep code clean & easily maintain by summarizing database-related logic within objects. By separating this, it makes the code easier to read, understand and to maintain.
- Testing
    - ORM assist us by making it easier to write test unit for database interactions, as we can mock ORM operations for testing purposes.
